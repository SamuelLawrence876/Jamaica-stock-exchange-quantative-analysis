## Project Intro
The objective of this project was to create a streamlined approach for deriving financial analysis on stocks from the jamaica stock exchange.

### Methods Used

* Data Analysis
* Machine Learning - Clustering
* Data Visualization
* Ratio Analysis
* Technical Analysis

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* FFN - Financial Functions for Python 

## Project Description
The Jamaica stock exchange has been known as one of the best performing stock markets around the world with more and more companies choosing to raise capital via equity.

While there are quite a few layers of analysis from the stocks chosen, the next step in this project would be to incorporate the entire index on a large scale, as well as provide more data analysis on the returns over the period. In addition to deploying a model to production
